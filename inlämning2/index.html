                Youtubability
            </h4>
            <p>
                A key driver of Youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the
                full potential of your game by working on
                getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your
                games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many elements can be used to make your
                game clearer:
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, ask yourself if a user’s interaction with the game is<strong> evident,</strong> for
                example, can she tell which character she
                <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it
                look <strong> fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the
                game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
                seconds (too long!).
            </p>   
            <p>
                Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate
                the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
                Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in
                orange here) and instantly recognized as
                a threat.

			        If you want to run user tests with
			        friends and family or even random
			        people in the street, it is interesting to
			        show them the 30 second video before
			        making them try to prototype in order
			        to <strong> understand their</strong> expectations from
			        the video vs. the actual game they try. <br>
			    </p>    
			    <p>
			    <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements 
			    that help <strong>understand the objective and
			    controls</strong> of the game, like with the
			    target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s
			    Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw
			    Car with the space dedicated to
			    drawing.

	        People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their
	        phone’s Facebook feed,</strong> everything will seem smaller than when
	        displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.<strong> You should
	        also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if
	        someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3
	        to 5 seconds, this is an <strong> accelerated elevator pitch!</strong> <br>
	    </p>
	    <p>    
	        Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on
	        YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea
	        for your game videos.
